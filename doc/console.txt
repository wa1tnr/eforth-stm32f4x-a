The RPi, breadboarded C8051F330D, and the STM32F405
(or 407 Discovery) are all riding on a chassis,
together.

The RPi is connected to HDMI display and USB keyboard.
In one mode, this subsystem acts as the terminal
(running picoterm or a python serial widget program)
to talk directly to the STM32 chip via its TX/RX pair
(USART) (one of them).

The eventual goal:

A .BIN is uploaded to STM32F405/7 that does only one
thing: it reads a full width port pin array (PORT_C
maybe?) and acts on what it sees.

This would allow very minimal .BIN construction on an
existing system, to bootstrap quite minimally, STM32.

This .BIN would:

 * setup GPIO on those pins - in INPUT mode (reading
   only).

 * loop:
   * Scan port pins (per above).
   * Load an address register (faked or real) with a new
     address, as specified on the bit pattern presented
     to the GPIO pin array
   * Scan port pins (again) per above.
   * Load the data (16 bits, twice iterated for a full
     32-bit wide memory-word) into the specfified address
     from the earlier step
   * Iterate until an additional .BIN image is created
     (in RAM, whatever seems easiest to accomplish, as
     the minimal .BIN is there to do 'bear claws and
     stone knives' monitoring, only).

    Edits - lay out function of .BIN monitor program,
    constructed in GNU assembler, most likely.

    Target: STM32F405 (or, 407 Disovery)

    Subgoal: establish physical parameters for a
    chassis (dimensions, holes to drill and such)
    for the console, based on programmatic requirements
    (presence or absence of RPi or Mini-ITX motherboard,
    its PSU, the C8051F330D, the STM32 target, support
    wiring and breadboarding requirements, interconnects
    using IDC ribbon cables, and the like).
