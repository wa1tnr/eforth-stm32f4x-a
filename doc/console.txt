The RPi, breadboarded C8051F330D, and the STM32F405
(or 407 Discovery) are all riding on a chassis,
together.

The RPi is connected to HDMI display and USB keyboard.
In one mode, this subsystem acts as the terminal
(running picoterm or a python serial widget program)
to talk directly to the STM32 chip via its TX/RX pair
(USART) (one of them).

The eventual goal:

A .BIN is uploaded to STM32F405/7 that does only one
thing: it reads a full width port pin array (PORT_C
maybe?) and acts on what it sees.

This would allow very minimal .BIN construction on an
existing system, to bootstrap quite minimally, STM32.

This .BIN would:

 * setup GPIO on those pins - in INPUT mode (reading
   only).

 * loop:
   * Scan port pins (per above).
   * Load an address register (faked or real) with a new
     address, as specified on the bit pattern presented
     to the GPIO pin array
   * Scan port pins (again) per above.
   * Load the data (16 bits, twice iterated for a full
     32-bit wide memory-word) into the specfified address
     from the earlier step
   * Iterate until an additional .BIN image is created
     (in RAM, whatever seems easiest to accomplish, as
     the minimal .BIN is there to do 'bear claws and
     stone knives' monitoring, only).
   * When deemed complete, the new .BIN sub-image is then
     branched to and thereby executed.

   * In theory, this adds additional functionality to
     the overall program running on the STM32F405/407
     target - possibly offering a bootloader segment that
     simply operates the GPIO port scan more effectively,
     to bootstrap further from 'near scratch' conditions
     (not written in GNU assembler, but more or less
     translated into address/data pairs to load into STM32
     RAM as a new subprogram to branch to).

   * Later, this becomes more fully implemented, possibly
     switching to another USART to start conversing with
     some other system that is used to help develop
     further.

   * It will not be desirable to carry the manual adding of
     bytes to STM32 RAM via 'bear claws' methodologies all
     that far, due to operator fatigue (and disinterest in
     doing things that way).

   * There should be a reasonable divide between methods,
     such that bootstrapping (even further) is somehow .. um ..
     made to be 'fun'.

   * Fault tolerance ought to be kept in mind, so that
     minor mistakes aren't as costly in early manual input
     iterations.

     Nobody wants to redo a done thing very many times, when
     the cost to do so is so high.  Early efforts to make
     this iteration cycle less costly (in time and effort).

    Edits - lay out function of .BIN monitor program,
    constructed in GNU assembler, most likely.

    Target: STM32F405 (or, 407 Disovery)

    Subgoal: establish physical parameters for a
    chassis (dimensions, holes to drill and such)
    for the console, based on programmatic requirements
    (presence or absence of RPi or Mini-ITX motherboard,
    its PSU, the C8051F330D, the STM32 target, support
    wiring and breadboarding requirements, interconnects
    using IDC ribbon cables, and the like).
