MOTIVATION

Some of this looks like a fool's errand; the purpose
(initially) of this file is to counter that. ;)

There are lots (and lots) of unfinished or abandoned
efforts found on github, wrt forth (generally) and to
assembler (mostly incomplete or simplified or both).

At least one project maintainer bothered to create a
decent (follow-able) Makefile and such (.ld file for
example) that looks correct and fairly complete.

Language barrier is another issue (mecrisp written
in what appears to be a dialect of 'german' (guessing).
