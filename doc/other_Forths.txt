  ColorForth

    Howerd (@uk) ported ColorForth to a USB booting/saving
    config, which does run on Via Epia (ML600 possibly; has
    the cle266 foo part in it).  It crashes very often,
    though seems to be highly deterministic (be very careful
    when rubbing out words to clear a copied block; maybe
    other crashes).  Reliable enough to experiment with,
    however.

    cf appears to support both ethernet and RS-232, already.

    The rs-232 in particular may be of interest in this project.

    The howerd port/modification to cf only supports HTNL (AOEU)
    ch'dvorak keymapping.

    On the Via Epia, 1024x768 comes up automatically and seems
    to function fairly well (VESA).

    On same, both USB and PS/2 keyboads work fine.

    The USB flash drive used is a dirt cheap Staples branded
    one (in silver with a prominent red LED) at 64 MB (iirc).

    Boots fine, but is slow to startup (> 30 seconds).

    Saves back to USB fine, also (amazing!)

    This provides a completely silent experience (the Epia
    motherboard is fanless and is configured with a DC-DC
    converter @12 VDC input supply, regulated).

    Other versions of ColorForth boot from FDD on this
    same substrate (and are even more stable; in fact one
    of them is remembered as never crashing at all -- not
    sure which version that was; maybe 2.0 and may be
    CM sourced COLOR.COM in origin).

    UI: cf generally executes on space bar flogging, so
        that can explain bias towards that method of input
        seen in other forth implementations.

        If the typist (operator) has been trained on ColorForth,
        they may well prefer this method to 'only when the line ends'
        input methods.

END.
