  interconnects - adafruit's new ribbon cable to green sloper binding posts (set screw)

  Adafruit 4435 (an 'also' to the below) - DIN rail pcb holder

  http://adafru.it/4436 DIN rail adaptor, IDC 2x8 to terminal blocks

  61 x 51   35 on the DIN rail - datasheet says

  ADR3575-S1700-ND 17" 7.5 din rail 35mm - Value Added (shows backordered but is fulfilled anyway)

  1920-1122-ND 1 meter long many in stock but is steel


  http://adafru.it/4170 2x8 12" IDC cable (not a good solution to
                                           a breadboard termination)

  Had considered real binding posts; this does a similar job.

  LED arrays: how to connect directly to the LED arrays (and how to
  provide for common anode (cathode) connections, close by).

  The two may be related.
 


  1456WL1BKBU - Hammond aluminum sloped chassis.

  Assumption was that the drawing showed a realistic scaling,
  whereas the photo of this chassis clearly shows the flanges
  are *much* smaller than as drawn, so the drawing is more
  conceptual than a 1:1 dimensional representation (in the
  very same way some road maps exxagerate road widths for
  sake of clarity and simplicity of understanding).

  This is very good news, as the originally depiction led
  to a belief that the chassis flanges would interfere (quite
  strongly) with separation for work to be done to each half
  in different contexts.

  Specifically, joining the two halves, electrically, using
  the base as an active substrate (mounting surface for
  larger assemblies, including target boards and breadboards).

END.
